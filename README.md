HTML and CSS projects to practice. Since those projects are very simple, I've compilated them in the same repo, with a branch for each project.

Projects:
1. Home_Page_1: responsive homepage with a few animations.
2. Home_Page_2: homepage using flexbox and animations.
3. Spotify404: Spotify's 404 error page copy, using flexbox, css grid and media queries for responsiveness.
